Web Application of Travel places
Developed a web application to enable users to share various places they have visited.
Users can sign in, create a user profile, create a list of their favourite travel places and share it with other users. Users can
also upload the placeâ€™s photos and location is displayed.
Developed UI features using ReactJS which interacted with the backend using REST Apis in NodeJS and used MongoDB
to store the data about entities like user, place.
